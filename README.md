Midterm
It incomplete the 1 week it was enough to do this the reason it was because i had a lot of things was happinging in my life at the moment which effected(family and love life) my performance and while having 4 days work which greatly impacted the progress.

Escape room
Its a simple ecape room where you solve a riddle with 4 shapes you pick up object by Holding E and drag it to to the pedestal that is next to a door.

The pedestal and door detection doesnt work i have left the code but it doesnt open. but the picking up item and physics and colision do work
